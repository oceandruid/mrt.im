This year I’m trying one: I’m going to try to follow Dan Sinker’s guide on daily journaling (<a class=\"autolink\" href=\"https://dansinker.com/posts/reflections/\">https://dansinker.com/posts/reflections/</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I struggle with task management at work, and with keeping track of what I’ve done throughout the year.
